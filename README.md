# No-Context Window: Context-Free Long-Form Text Generation

A sophisticated AI-powered document processing pipeline designed for **context-free long-form content generation** and **automated financial report creation**. Built with LangChain and LangGraph, the system processes documents and generates structured reports through a series of nodes in a multi-step pipeline.

## 🌟 Features

- **Context-Free Long-Form Generation**: Generate long-form content without requiring pre-established context.
- **Automated Financial Report Generation**: Generates detailed financial reports from raw input data.
- **Customizable Workflow**: Easily integrate new nodes and steps into the pipeline.
- **Support for Multiple LLM Providers**: Flexibility to use different language models for various tasks.
- **Structured Outputs**: Generates structured content in multiple formats such as Markdown, JSON, and plain text.

## 🏗️ Architecture

The system leverages a **directed graph workflow** for document processing, with nodes responsible for different stages of the pipeline. The architecture includes:

1. **Planning Node**: Analyzes the input documents, extracts key information, and generates a structured plan for the content.
2. **Writing Node**: Generates the content based on the plan created by the Planning Node.
3. **Saving Node**: Handles the output formatting and persistence (e.g., Markdown or JSON files).
4. **Financial Report Node** (optional): Specialized node for generating financial reports from structured data.

## 📁 Project Structure

The project is organized into the following directory structure:

```

├── chains/

```

- `LLMs/`: Contains LLM configuration files for different models.
- `chains/`: Defines the chains of processing steps (planning, writing, financial reports, etc.).
- `nodes/`: Implements individual nodes that handle specific tasks in the pipeline (e.g., planning, writing).
- `graph.py`: Manages the workflow graph and execution.
- `tools.py`: Contains utility functions and helpers for text processing.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- LangChain
- LangGraph

### Installation

To install the required dependencies, run the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage

Here’s an example of how to use the pipeline:

```python
from graph import create_workflow
from your_llm_config import llm

# Create the workflow
workflow = create_workflow(llm)

# Execute the workflow
result = workflow.invoke({
    "initial_prompt": "Generate a detailed financial report for Q3 2024",
    "llm_name": "llama-3.1-70b-groq",
    "num_steps": 3,
    "word_count": 2000
})
```

## 💡 How It Works

1. **Input**: The system receives a raw document or prompt (e.g., "Generate a financial report for Q3 2024").
2. **Planning Node**: The planning node processes the input, identifies key components (e.g., date ranges, financial categories), and generates a structured outline.
3. **Writing Node**: The writing node uses the generated plan to write detailed content. If it's a financial report, it will fetch data and use it to generate the narrative.
4. **Saving Node**: The content is saved in the desired format (e.g., Markdown, JSON).

For advanced use cases, you can add custom nodes, integrate different language models, or modify the pipeline to suit your specific requirements.

## 🔧 Configuration

You can configure various options for the workflow in the **GraphState**:

```python
GraphState = {
    "initial_prompt": str,    # Initial input prompt
    "plan": str,              # Generated plan
    "num_steps": int,         # Number of processing steps
    "final_doc": str,         # Final generated document
    "write_steps": List[str], # Steps in the writing process
    "word_count": int,        # Target word count
    "llm_name": str           # Name of the LLM being used (e.g., llama-3.1-70b-groq)
}
```

This allows you to adjust the input prompt, number of steps in the pipeline, and the language model being used.

## 📄 Output Formats

- **Markdown**: Generates content in markdown format (e.g., reports, articles).
- **JSON**: Provides structured output in JSON format, useful for data analysis.
- **Text**: Plain text output for quick reports or summaries.
- **Financial Reports**: Detailed financial reports with proper structuring and data integration.

## 🚀 Example Workflow

```python
# Import necessary modules
from graph import create_workflow
from your_llm_config import llm

# Create the workflow with your LLM configuration
workflow = create_workflow(llm)

# Set the parameters and invoke the workflow
result = workflow.invoke({
    "initial_prompt": "Write a detailed analysis of Q3 financial performance.",
    "llm_name": "llama-3.1-70b-groq",
    "num_steps": 3,
    "word_count": 1500
})

# Output results
print(result['final_doc'])
```

### What Was Done:
- **Proper Markdown Formatting**: Headings, bullet points, and code blocks have been properly formatted for better readability.
- **Clear Structure**: Sections like features, architecture, installation, and usage examples are laid out for easy understanding.
- **Consistent Styling**: Each section follows a consistent style with appropriate emphasis on keywords like **bold** for important terms and **code blocks** for commands.

This version should now be well-structured and easy to navigate. Let me know if you'd like to add or change anything else!
